Files:

Makefile	# Compiles your shell program and runs the tests
README		# This file
tsh.c		  # The shell program 
tshref		# The reference shell binary (might need to "chmod +x tshref")

# The remaining files are used to test your shell
sdriver.pl	 # The trace-driven shell driver
trace*.txt	 # The 15 trace files that control the shell driver
tshref.out   # Example output of the shell on all 15 traces, execute in linux environment (might need to "chmod +x tshref.out")

# Little C programs that are called by the trace files
myspin.c	    # Takes argument <n> and spins for <n> seconds
mysplit.c	    # Forks a child that spins for <n> seconds
mystop.c      # Spins for <n> seconds and sends SIGTSTP to itself
myint.c       # Spins for <n> seconds and sends SIGINT to itself

# Note: I used cygwin to run this shell

How to run:
- first do "make tsh.c" and see that everything works fine
- do "./tsh.c" to run the shell
- "make test##" to run tests 1-16 on tsh.c EX: make test01
- "make rtest##" to see expected output from tshref.out
